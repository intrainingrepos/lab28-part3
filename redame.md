### Modules
#### `index.js`

### How it is all connected
The index.js file hold the main class and imports the app.js file in. The app.js file holds the work from the form. Then the form.js holds all of the work that the form does. The display.js file is also connected with the form.js file that does the work that the app.js file needs to make the form work properly.
